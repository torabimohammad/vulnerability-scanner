# Vulnerability Scanner

## Description
Scanner.py is a Python script that allows you to scan a network for open ports on specified IP addresses or hostnames. It utilizes the `socket` library in Python to establish connections with the target hosts and check for open ports. 

The program is dockerized, meaning it is packaged as a Docker container along with all the necessary dependencies and services. The Dockerfile contains the instructions for building the container and specifying the services that should be running inside it.

## Features
- Scans IP addresses or hostnames
- Provides detailed information about open ports, including the service running on each port
- Allows customization of timeout and maximum number of threads for parallel scanning

## Usage

1. Install Docker if you haven't already.
2. Clone or download the repositories [Swit-Scanner](https://github.com/RedSecurity/swit-scanner) and [DirSearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) to your local machine in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and build the Docker container from docker-compose.yml using the following command:
    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```
5. Run the container if they are not runnig already. You can find all the necessary from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/).
6. Run the script using the following command:
    ```
    python or python3 scanner.py [options] [targets]
    ```
    Replace `[options]` with any desired command-line options (e.g., `-wpscan-run -wpscan-url` to run the wpscan service) and `targets` with the IP addresses and its hostname you want to scan (e.g., `-wpscan-url` to run the wpscan for the specific url)
6. Wait for the program to complete the scanning process.
7. Review the output to see the results of the scan.


## Dirsearch Installation and Usage
You would be possible to find complete documentation in [DirSearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch). However these are quick steps to run this service:
1. Clone repository [DirSearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch).
2. python3 dirsearch.py -u https://target
I have already implemented this service which in the following you are able to find out how it works in my program.

The result saves in the dirsearch/reporst or  ./reports file.

## Swit-Scanner Installation and Usage
You would be possible to find complete documentation in [Swit-Scanner](https://github.com/RedSecurity/swit-scanner). However these are quick steps to run this service:
1. Clone repository [Swit-Scanner](https://github.com/RedSecurity/swit-scanner).
2. cd swit-scanner
3. bash installer.sh

### If you do not use *_kali linux_* or *_parrot_* or ..., run the following command before running step 3

`sudo bash repository.sh`


### Just run the following command in the swit-scanner directory


`./swit-scanner`

### or

`bash swit-scanner`

The result saves in the swit-scanner file.

## Command-line Options
- `-list-containers`: Return the list of docker running containers that contain the services. This runs without `targets`.
- `-apache-version`: This command has to you the version of Apache webserver. You have to use the namd/container id that your service is running to return its version.
 You have to use url target after this command using `` command.
- `-mysql-version`: This command has to you the version of MySQL. You have to use the namd/container id that your service is running to return its version.
- `-wordpress-version`: This command has to you the version of Wordpress. You have to use the namd/container id that your service is running to return its version.
- `-phpmyadmin-version`: This command has to you the version of phpMyAdmin. You have to use the namd/container id that your service is running to return its version.
- `-wpscan-run`: Start scan all the possibple vulnerability for WordPress. You have to use url target after this using `-wpscan-url` command (e.g., `-wpscan-run -wpscan-url http://localhost:8080`).
- `-dirsearch-run`: Start scan all the files in target url. It scans and gives you all the files existing in the website wth their response number (/usr/app/test.txt --> 200). You have to use url target after this using `-dirsearch-url` command.
- `-vul-services`: By passing it, you have to enter the name of services then their version to give return the vulnerabilities for that service.



## Example
To scan ports 80 on the host `localhost`, run the following command:
`python or python3 scanner.py -wpscan-run -wpscan-url http://localhost:8080`
